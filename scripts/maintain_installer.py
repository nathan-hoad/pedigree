----------------------------------------------------

This script contains a set of functions which can be used in other
Python scripts or from the command line.

It should be noted that all relative paths are relative to the
_install ISO_ directory, not the current working directory. For
Pedigree, this is in images/install/disk/install-files.

---------- To add a file to the installer ----------
./scripts/maintain_installer.py add <relative path to file> \
                                    <file to install as> <compulsory>

For instance, the line for bash would be:
./scripts/maintain_installer.py add /applications/bash /applications/bash yes

Pass "-" as the destination to specify "Same as source" (to avoide duplication
as seen above).

The line for an empty file would be:
./scripts/maintain_installer.py add - /my_empty.txt yes

NOTE: No sanity checking is performed - ensure that the file is not already in
the list, or else it will be installed twice by the installer.

---------- To remove a file from the installer ----------
./scripts/maintain_installer.py remove <relative path to file>

So to remove bash from the installer:
./scripts/maintain_installer.py remove /applications/bash

Removing an empty file does not require any special changes, as the script
will automatically find empty files and handle their unique syntax properly.

You may specify a regular expression to remove multiple files.

---------- To list files in the installer ----------
./scripts/maintain_installer.py list <optional path>

So to list the applications directory:
./scripts/maintain_installer.py list /applications/

The list operation will recursively list files as they would appear on the
destination disk when installed. The path may be a regular expression, such as:

./scripts/maintain_installer.py list "/[acu]+.*?"

Which will display:
/applications/bash
/applications/ls
......
/config/greeting
......
/config/lynx/lynx.cfg
......
/users/james/.bashrc

----------------------------------------------------

Note: This script could probably be cleaned up a fair bit :)
